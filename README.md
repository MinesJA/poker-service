* Terminology

# MetaHand -

Describes the types of hands one could get (Pair, Three of a Kind, Straight Flush, etc.)

# Hand -

Describes all hands availible for play, both cards in a players hand as well as the community cards. This is a slight adjustment to the typical definition of a hand in poker, which only describes the 5 cards that could potentially be a playable MetaHand. We include all 7 because we're looking for the full range of possible hands which may include two different combinations of 5 cards.

* Hand Identification

Hand identification does not identify the best MetaHand, but all MetaHands that could possibly be made from a Hand.
